# Kawai K3

- ****Formats:**** EXS24, Kontakt & SFZ (partial), TAL-Sampler

  **TAL-Sampler:**    
  A specific pack for TAL-Sampler was created by [Krezie Sounds](https://www.kreziesounds.com/).
  This pack contains the same sounds, but recreated with a much smaller subset of the original samples in line with the spirit of more vintage style sampling in TAL-       Sampler.
  For TAL-Sampler you only need the "K3 for TAL Sampler" zip package from the [Audio Page](https://github.com/publicsamples/Kawai-K3/releases/).
